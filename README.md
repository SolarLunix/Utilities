# Utilities
This Repository is for utilities that I use often.

## [Convert Table](https://github.com/SolarLunix/Utilities/blob/master/ConvertTable.py)
The utilities in this file are specifically for converting tables from one file format to another.

### csv_to_md 
This is used primarily to convert from the csv formatt to a markdown format for use in notes.

### pandas_switch
This method was created as an easy way to switch between two file formats, and would probably be considered the default method to use. This method is defaulted to switch from a .tsv file to a .csv file.

### pandas_to_yaml
This method was created to take any pandas readable file and output it into a yaml file.

## [Files](https://github.com/SolarLunix/Utilities/blob/master/Files.py)
This utility is meant to help manage files

### createDateFilename
This method is used to create a filename which is date-time stamped. It's primarily used when creating a large number of outputs.
