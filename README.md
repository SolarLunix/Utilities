This is used primarily to convert from the csv formatt to a markdown format for use in notes

## pandas_switch
This method was created as an easy way to switch between two file formats, and would probably be considered the default method to use
This method is defaulted to switch from a .tsv file to a .csv file

## pandas_to_yaml
This method was created to take any pandas readable file and output it into a yaml file.
